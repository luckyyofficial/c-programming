# 💻 Introduction to C Language

C is a **general-purpose, procedural programming language** developed in the early 1970s by **Dennis Ritchie** at Bell Labs. It is known for its **efficiency, speed, and low-level access to memory**, which makes it a foundational language for many modern systems.

### 🔎 Key Features:
- 🔧 **Procedural** and **structured** programming style  
- ⚙️ Low-level memory manipulation via pointers  
- 💡 Powerful and efficient for system-level programming  
- 🌐 Portable and widely supported across platforms  
- 🧱 Forms the basis for many other languages (C++, Java, etc.)

### 📘 Simple Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
